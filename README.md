# Xcelerate

Xcelerate is a .NET Core 8 API for uploading and processing large Excel files, with a focus on efficient data storage in an MSSQL database. This project utilizes Hangfire for background task processing, ensuring smooth management of long-running tasks such as file parsing, data validation, and record storage.

## Features

- **Large File Uploading**: Designed to handle large Excel files with robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
- **Data Parsing and Validation**: Comprehensive parsing of Excel data with customizable validation rules to ensure data integrity.
- **Background Task Processing**: Hangfire integration for asynchronous task management, allowing resource-intensive processes to run in the background without blocking main application threads.
- **MSSQL Database Storage**: Uses MSSQL as the primary data store, providing secure and efficient data handling capabilities.
- **Error Monitoring**: Real-time error logging for troubleshooting, with detailed log information to support debugging.
- **Dashboard Monitoring**: Integrates with Hangfireâ€™s dashboard to monitor job statuses, retries, and completion metrics.
- **Scalability and Performance**: Optimized to support large datasets, asynchronous processing, and multiple simultaneous uploads.
